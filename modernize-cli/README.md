# GitHub Copilot modernization CLI

## What is GitHub Copilot modernization CLI?

[GitHub Copilot modernization](https://aka.ms/ghcp-appmod) provides AI-powered capabilities to help users modernize Java and .NET applications easily and confidently.

Organizations modernizing multiple applications need consistency, repeatability, and the ability to define standards that apply across every dev team and repository. The [GitHub Copilot Modernization Agent](https://aka.ms/ghcp-modernization-agent) is built for these requirements.

Delivered through the Modernize CLI, the modernization agent enables agentic, end-to-end application modernization through intelligent workflow orchestration. It provides architects and app owners with a platform to define modernization standards once - via customizable, reusable skills - and apply them consistently across multiple applications and repositories. It offers a unified CLI and TUI experience for hands-on modernization of individual applications.

## Installation

### Linux / macOS

**Option 1 — Homebrew:**
```bash
brew tap microsoft/modernize https://github.com/microsoft/modernize-cli
brew install modernize
```

**Option 2 — Shell script:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/modernize-cli/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

The script automatically downloads the latest release, install the modernize bundle to `~/.local/share/modernize`, place the `modernize` command in `~/.local/bin`, and add the command directory to your PATH.

After installation, reload your shell profile to apply the PATH update:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc   # or source ~/.zshrc for Zsh
```

> [!NOTE]
> **For Linux users:** Requires **glibc 2.27+** (Ubuntu 18.04+, Debian 10+, Fedora 29+, Azure Linux 2.0+).

### Windows

**Option 1 — Winget:**
```powershell
winget install GitHub.Copilot.modernization.agent
```

For silent installation (no prompts):
```powershell
winget install GitHub.Copilot.modernization.agent --silent
```

**Option 2 — PowerShell one-liner:**
```powershell
iex (irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/modernize-cli/main/scripts/install.ps1)
```

**Option 3 — MSI installer:**

Download and run the latest MSI from the [Releases page](https://github.com/microsoft/modernize-cli/releases/latest).

All three options place the `modernize` command in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\modernize` and add it to your PATH automatically.

> [!NOTE]
> After installation, open a new terminal for the `modernize` command to be available on your PATH.
